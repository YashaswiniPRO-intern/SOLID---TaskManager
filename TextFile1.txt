Task Manager :

SRP(Single Responsibility Principle): a class must have single reason to change
TaskModel - represents only data
TaskService - Business logic
TaskRepo - DB operations
TaskController - Exposes API endpoints

OCP(Open Closed Principle):Open for extension, closed for modification
ITaskService and ITaskRepository - allow for extension without modification i.e 
we can simply extend repo and service without modifying existing classes.
Interfaces and automapper allows extension without modifying core logic.

LSP:(Liskov Substitution Principle):A child class must be substitutable for the base class without changing the behavior(of base class) 
Since TaskService and TaskRepo depend on interfaces rather than concrete implementations...we can easily replace
those classes with another DB implementation.

ISP(Interface Segregation Principle):A class should not be forced to implement unecessary interfaces/methods.
ITaskService: defines only the methods related to task logic.
ITaskRepository: DB operations
The classes do not implement uneccesary methods.

DI(Dependency Inversion):high-level module should not be dependent on low level modules, instead both must be dependent on abstractions(interfaces)
TaskController depends on ITaskService and not TaskService directly;
TaskService depends on ITaskRepository and not TaskRepository directly.
